This is a template project for LangChain applications in [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/). [Try it out](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/Codeanywhere-Templates/langchain)


### What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications. This template showcases several core LangChain capabilities including:

- **Agents & Tools**: Dynamic decision-making on which tools to use based on user input
- **Chains**: Combining LLMs with other components for specific workflows
- **Memory**: Maintaining context throughout a conversation
- **Document Loaders**: Extracting content from external sources
- **LLM Integration**: Leveraging OpenAI models for sophisticated language tasks
- **Prompt Templates**: Structured prompting for consistent LLM outputs

## Getting Started

Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Open the terminal and run the interactive demo:
```bash
python sample.py
```

All dependencies are pre-installed in the devcontainer.

## Features

- üîç **Web Search**: Query information from Wikipedia and DuckDuckGo using LangChain's search tool integrations
- üìÑ **Webpage Processing**: Extract and summarize content from any URL with WebBaseLoader and LLM summarization
- üß† **Research Notes Generation**: Create structured research notes using LLM chains and prompt engineering
- üåê **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Visualize entity relationships with LLM-powered knowledge extraction
- üí¨ **Conversational Memory**: Maintain context with ConversationBufferMemory

## Usage Examples

### Web Search
```bash
# Start the demo and then type:
"Search for information about quantum computing"
```

### Webpage Analysis
```bash
# Start the demo and then type:
"Summarize the webpage https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction"
```

### Research Notes
```bash
# Start the demo and then type:
"Generate research notes on climate change"
```

### Knowledge Graphs
```bash
# Start the demo and then type:
"Create a knowledge graph about artificial intelligence"
```

### General Conversation
```bash
# The demo maintains context throughout your session:
"What can you tell me about machine learning?"
"How does it compare to deep learning?"
```
